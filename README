Completed Functionality So Far!
   Client Side: Connects to socket.
                Register a new username/password.
                Login to server with username/password.
                Logout of server.
                Get a list of who is logged in.
                Send a private message to a user.
                Send a Global Message.
                Get the info on a buddy who is logged in.
                Change you own personal buddy info.
                Quit program.
               
    Server Side: Connects socket to client.  Upon connection the clients
                   ipaddress is added to a hash.  This info is later used
                   to deny any other logins from the same machine.
                 When client tries to register a new username/password
                   the server looks for an entry in the password file
                   and either denies or grants the new user.  Granting 
                   the user results in the new info being added to the
                   password file.
                 Authenticate user login with info from the client and  
                   info in the password file. TODO: once authenticated the
                   hash should be updated to reflect the new status of 
                   the client.
                 When client logs out of the server the hash is modified
                   and the socket is terminated.
                 When the client quits, or when the connection to the client
                   is lost, the user is automatically logged out of the
                   server.
                 Relay a private message from the sender to the recipient.
                 Relay a Global Message to all logged on users.
                 Allow the client to query another users info.
                 Allow a client to change his/her own private info.


   Scheduled for release 0.2.0 - (Yeah I know some of these were in the
                                  0.1.0 release but I never got them done.)

   TODO: Prohibit multiple user logins at the same time.  (i.e. do not allow
         user to login as xxx, and then login as yyy without first logging
         out of xxx.

         Make the client more responsive (i.e. eliminate the pause caused by
         the use of a timer).
    
         better organize the connect_serv() procedure in the client.

         $conn_stat should be updated sometime regularly in the client.

         Filter out messages so the client cannot send a '::' to the server 
           or change the character that separates the fields of data, or
           allow arrays to be passed through the sockets.

         Get rid of globals $pass, $user in the client.

         check for stale users that no longer exist on the server.

         update clients when new user logs in/out on the server.

         Block users from registering multiple names in a certian
           time period on the server.

         Block multiple logins from the same host on the server.

Getting the Perl Interpreter:
          Visit   http://www.perl.com   or   http://www.activestate.com
          Follow the directions that come with Perl whether you are 
          compiling your own binary or getting theirs, the directions that
          come with perl are very good.

Getting the Tk module:
          Under Linux:
            Get the tarball from 
              http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/N/NI/NI-S/Tk800.022.tar.gz
              *must do the below as root user*
              % tar -zxvf Tk800.022.tar.gz
              % perl Makefile.PL
              % make
              % make test
              % make install

          Under Win32:
              Open a NT console or a msdos prompt and enter:
              c:\> ppm
              ppm> install Tk

Running The Program:
          Under Linux:
              change into the directory where the perl program is located
              % ./client.pl 
              or 
              % ./server.pl

          Under Win32:
              Double click on client.pl or server.pl in Windows Explorer.
              or
              Open a NT console or a msdos prompt
              change into the directory where client.pl or server.pl resides
                 c:\> client.pl
                 or
                 c:\> server.pl
